 <b>PUBLIC STUN SERVER LIST</b>
________

### HELPME!
I don't don't have a lot time to build the php and javascript Class. If people wanna help, contact me!
We could keep this list up-to-date together!

### TODO
Script to check (php, js):
 - Easy to use classes
 - if servers work, with automatic report
 - No doubles
 - Easy add servers
 - Set favorites
 - other things...

### TEST SERVERS
If you got new servers or servers that are down report it. <br>
[Check here](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/) if server is alive.

### Install
