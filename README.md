 <b>PUBLIC STUN SERVER LIST</b>
________

### HELPME!
I don't have a lot of time, so if people are interesting in helping with this project contact me!
Maybe we could keep this list up-to-date together.

### TEST SERVERS
If you got new servers or servers that are down report it. <br>
[Check here](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/) if server is alive.

### Install
```
composer require strapatsen/stunservers
```

________
### TODO
Script to check (php, js):
 - if servers work, with automatic report
 - No doubles
 - Easy add servers
 - Set favorites
 - other things...
